# B2B-small-scale-Password-Encrytion
Project for the course "Data Structures and Algorithms". Built with Python, this software encrypts the master password using more than one algorithm so that the encrypted password can be stored in the concerned database. Such encryption makes the master password inaccessible to the people who can potentially access that database, such as employees, back-end engineers, hackers etc. Algorithms used here range from advanced ciphers to bitwise XOR encryption and IV456 encryption. This software can be used by companies to store passwords of their employees' login-id, or by any other website which uses password as a key to keeping their user's data private.
